This is a post I wrote while I was working at Drivy, as we were tweaking the models state machines. You can find it here : [https://drivy.engineering/designing-state-machines/](https://drivy.engineering/designing-state-machines/).

As a TLDR; this post suggests :

- Keep it as simple as possible
- Talk with all your team-mates to understand the vocabulary
- Do not over-anticipate your future needs
- Store all relevant infos including the transitions from state to state

I initially presented these tips as a lightning talk for the [ParisRb meetup on 05/07/2016](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/parisrb/events/rqtgrlyvkbhb/).
